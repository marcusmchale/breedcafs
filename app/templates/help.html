		<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
			<p>
                Countries, Regions and Farms provide location context for <a href="#fields">Fields</a>
                , a core component of the BreedCAFS data model. The Farm represents a large farm or research facility
				where multiple fields and/or growth environments are available.
			</p>
		<h3 id="fields">Fields</h3>
			<p>
				The Field represents a collection of <a href="#trees">Trees</a> under common non-experimental conditions.
                It is also the largest unit in the BreedCAFS data model to which records may be attributed.

                In a typical farm setting the Field will be a single field,
				although in BreedCAFS on-farm trials it may represent an entire small-holder farm.
				In research facilities with controlled growth environments, the Field will likely be a glasshouse
                or a collection of chambers.
			</p>
			<p>
                To facilitate the data submission and retrieval process,
				each Field is registered to a Farm and assigned a unique identifier (UID).
				For Fields this UID is an integer (e.g. "1") that increments with each additional field in the database.
			</p>
		<h3  id="blocks">Blocks</h3>
			<p>
				Blocked experimental designs are often necessary to account for conditions (nuisance factors) that vary
				within a given field. Similarly, in controlled growth experiments such variation is often found
				between growth chambers. To facilitate analyses in such experimental designs,
                <a href="#trees">Trees</a> can be optionally assigned to Blocks within a <a href="#fields">Field</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blocks are assigned a UID that is incremented from the <a href="#fields">Field</a> UID.
				As an example, "1_B2" is the UID for the second block registered within the <a href="#fields">Field</a>
                with UID 1. Blocks are best added first so that subsequent <a href="#trees">Trees</a>
                may be registered directly into a Block.
                However, <a href="#trees">Trees</a> may be later assigned to a
                Block (must be in the same field) by recording the registered block name in the "Assign to block" input variable.
			</p>
		<h3 id="trees">Trees</h3>
			<p>
				Trees are registered within a <a href="#fields">Field</a> and optionally within a <a href="#blocks">Block</a>.
                Each Tree is assigned a UID that increments from the <a href="#fields">Field</a> UID.
				As an example, "1_T2" is the UID for the second tree registered within the <a href="#fields">Field</a> with UID 1.
			</p>
            <p>
                In registering Trees you are be provided a BreedCAFS template listing the Tree UIDs and allowing you
                to record details for later <a href="#upload">submission</a>. This same template can also be generated on the
                <a href="#record">Record</a> page by selecting the "Registration" input group.

            Items
        </h3>
            <p>
                If each sample to be collected is representative of a <a href="#fields">Field</a>
                or <a href="#trees">Tree</a> then select the corresponding level.
            </p>
            <p>
                If each sample is representative of a collection of <a href="#trees">Trees</a>
                (i.e. pooled) then select "Field" and later associate each sample with a list of Tree IDs
                by recording the "Assign to trees" condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                For sub-sampling (i.e. splitting a sample into multiple representative samples),
                select "Sample". This is designed to support distributing samples among labs
                and where samples may be split for different post-harvest processing procedures.
                New IDs are generated but the association with the original sample is preserved in the database.

        <h3>
            Filters
        </h3>
            <p>
                The filters allow you to select specific items to sample (Fields/Trees/Samples).
                Your selection here will update the <a href="#selection">selection</a> below.

            </p>
            <p>
                You can then optionally specify the number of samples to register per item (default is 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                When you register samples you are provided a BreedCAFS template detailing the sample UIDs
                and allowing you to record details for later <a href="#upload">submission</a>.
                This same template can also be generated on the

        Record data
    </h2>
        <p>
            This page allows users to either <a href="#direct">directly submit</a> records or
            generate templates to record data in <a href="#spreadsheet">spreadsheet software</a> such as Microsoft Excel,
            or alternatively generate files required for the <a href="#field book">Field Book</a> application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Templates you have already generated can be found through the
            <a href="{{  url_for('download') }}">download page</a> among your
            <a href="{{  url_for('download_files') }}">generated files</a>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Items
        </h3>
        <p>
            To record data the first step is to filter for items for which you intend to submit records.
            The type of item, be it <a href="#fields">Field</a>, <a href="#trees">Tree</a>
            or <a href="#samples">Sample</a>, will determine the subsequent options that are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the item type selected, use the location and ID filters to narrow down to the desired items.
            The number of items selected is displayed under "Selection".
        </p>
        <h3>
            Input variables
        </h3>
        <p>
            Once you have established your selection of items, you may now select the variables
            for which you intend to record data. Input variables fall into four supported record types,
            <a href="#properties">Properties</a>,
            <a href="#traits">Traits</a>,
            <a href="#curves">Curves</a> and
            <a href="#conditions">Conditions</a>.
        <p>
            Input variables are further organised into groups to facilitate selection (even across multiple record types).
            Select a group and then chose from among the variables in that group.
            If the group of variables you would like to select is not available then please contact an admin
            to create a new group.
        </p>
        <h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet software</h3>
            <p>
                In most cases users are familiar with <a href="#spreadsheet">spreadsheet table templates</a>
                for data collection.
                In BreedCAFS templates the input variables are split into a worksheet per record type
                and a worksheet per variable for curve type variables.
                Additional worksheets are provided with details about the item (Item Details) and input variables (Input Variable Details).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are aggregating data from multiple periods of recording you may want a table that contains
                rows for multiple records per selected item.
                For convenience, the number of duplicated rows per item can be set by the "time points" value.
                Time points is distinct from replicates which allow the submission and identification of multiple values
                at a single time-point (see <a href="#traits">traits</a> description for details).
            </p>
            <p>
                To generate spreadsheet table templates for the selected items and input variables,
                simply select "Table (xlsx)" in the drop down box (selected by default)
                and click "Generate template".
            </p>
        <h3 id="direct">Direct submission</h3>
            <p>
                To easily make direct submissions of a single value for a set of items a web-form is provided.
                Please ensure you have carefully selected the items as the same value will be recorded for the entire selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, to make a <a href="#direct">direct submission</a> the record type must be selected
                and curves are not supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                With items, input variables and record type selected, simply enter values for all selected input variables and click submit.
                You will receive a report in the browser window that will either confirm your submission or warn of errors and/or conflicts.
            </p>
        <h3 id = "field book">Field Book application</h3>
            <p>
                The Field Book application is designed to support data collection for simple traits.
                To facilitate the use of this application the database tools site can generate the required input files;
                "traits.trt" and "fields.csv". More detailed instructions on using Field Book application are available
                <a href=" {{  url_for('field_book_help') }}">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                To generate the Field Book input files the "Trait" record type must be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                With items, input variables and record type selected, simply select "Field Book (csv)"
                in the drop down box and click "Generate template".
            </p>
        <h3>Record Types</h3>
        <h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
            <p>
                Properties have a single value for each item. These include "variety name" and "planting date".
            </p>
        <h4 id="traits">Traits</h4>
            <p>
                Traits have a single value for each item at an assessed time point.

                Replicates at a single time-point are supported and identifiable by replicate ID which is simply an integer (e.g. "1")
                concatenated to the UID following a period ".".
                For example, two replicate UIDs for 1_T1 would be "1_T1.1" and "1_T1.2".
                Replicate codes are only guaranteed unique at a single time point.
            </p>
        <h4 id="curves">Curves</h4>
            <p>
                Curves have a paired list of independent ("X") and dependent ("Y") variables for each item at an assessed time point.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for traits, replicates are supported through replicate codes
                (see <a href="#traits">traits</a> description for details).
            </p>
            <p>
                The templates for curve input variables are generated as a worksheet for each input variable.
                These worksheets will include column headers for the required (UID, Date) and optional (Time, Person) details
                while the rest of the worksheet is left blank. To input data into these worksheets, simply include the "X" value
                as a column header and the "Y" value in the corresponding row. Both "X" and "Y" values must be floating point numbers.
            </p>
        <h4 id="conditions">Conditions</h4>
            <p>
                Conditions have a single value for any given period.
                The start and end time of this period are optionally defined in each record,
                however the following rules apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a condition is set without bounds (i.e. without start or end) then no differing
                        record will be accepted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a single bound is set (start or end) then no differing record
                        with an opposite bound (i.e. end or start respectively)
                        will be accepted in the unbounded direction (later or earlier respectively) .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fully bound records (preferred) will not be accepted
                        where they differ with any record that has an overlapping period.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These rules can lead to a situation where to set a new value for an unbounded condition,
                an existing record must be <a href="#correct">deleted</a>.
            </p>

        Upload data
    </h2>
        <p>
            This is the portal to submit templates and exported data from Field Book.
            A simple graphic is displayed to provide immediate feedback on the submission process.
        </p>
        <p>
            For <a href="#spreadsheet">table templates</a> simply select "Table (xlsx, csv)" in the drop down menu
            then either drag and drop your file onto the icon below
            or click the icon to use your browser to select a file to upload.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be given feedback about the upload process and a report either confirming the submission or
            alerting you of any errors will be returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the upload itself is complete you will be notified that the file is being checked.
            At this stage you may navigate away from the page if desired.
            An email will be sent detailing the outcome of your submission.
        </p>
        <p>
            In these reports, frequently a table is returned, detailing the line number containing the error.
            If there are highlighted cells in these tables
            simply hover the mouse over the cell to see more details about the error.

			Both database format (single row per item/time/trait) and table format (single row per item)
			are provided.
			The database format contains additional information about who submitted the data (user and partner)
			as well as when, where and by whom (if using Field Book) this data was collected.
			The table format may be useful in simple cases although please note:
			when multiple data points are found for a single trait, these will be returned

        Delete records
    </h2>
        <p>
            To delete records (and revert property changes) you need to upload a file containing the specific records

        </p>
        <p>
            If you just uploaded the records and you want to delete the entire submission then the submission report file is suitable.
            Otherwise generate a "database" format file on the download page using appropriate filters to include only the records you want to delete.
            You may also manually remove rows from this generated file if you can't find all the appropriate filters.
            With this file now describing the records you want to delete, simply upload the file on the <a href=""{{ url_for('correct') }}>correct</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Partner admins are able to delete records submitted by all members of their institute.
            Other users are only be able to delete their own records.
            If your report implies that the records cannot be found despite you being able to access these records
            through the download page then you may need to contact the relevant partner admin to have these records deleted.
