	<h2>Delete Records</h2>
        <p>To delete records (and revert property changes) you need a file containing the specific records you want to delete.</p>
        <p>If you just uploaded the records and you want to delete the entire submission
            then the submission report file is suitable. Otherwise generate a "database" format file on the download page using appropriate filters
            to include only the records you want to delete. You may also manually remove rows from this generated file
            if you can't find all the appropriate filters. With this file now describing the records you want to delete, simply upload the file here.
        </p><br>
        <p>Partner admins are able to delete records submitted by all members of their institute. Other users are only be able
            to delete their own records. If your report implies that the records cannot
            be found despite you being able to access these records through the download page
            then you may need to contact the relevant partner admin to have these records deleted.
        </p>
