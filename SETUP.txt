This all depends on a working neo4j install. For development we perform setup in a virtual environment. 
An instance folder containing a config file is required but not available in the github repo. 
This file contains the following and you can request a (redacted) copy from marcus or build your own:
	SECRET-KEY 
	ALLOWED_EMAILS
	ADMINS
	UPLOAD-FOLDER
	DOWNLOAD-FOLDER
	MAIL-SERVER (and associated values)

SETUP:
Clone the breedcafs repository:
	git clone https://github.com/marcusmchale/breedcafs

Add the instance folder:
	mkdir breedcafs/instance
	cp /path/to/file/config.py breedcafs/instance/config.py

Set up neo4j:
	Install:
		on ubuntu:
			sudo apt-get install neo4j
		on fedora:
			sudo yum install neo4j
	Run neo4j:
		sudo neo4j console
	Visit neo4j in the browser at localhost:7474 and configure username password (default is neo4j:neo4j)
	You will also need to export these values as environment variables (replace as configured):
		export NEO4J_USERNAME=username
		export NEO4J_PASSWORD=password

Set up virtual environment:
	Install:
		on ubuntu:
			sudo apt-get install virtualenv
		on fedora (was already installed for me in v25 but otherwise:
			sudo yum install python-virtualenv

	Initialise:
		virtualenv venv
	Activate (from breedcafs folder):
		. ./venv/bin/activate
	Install requirements:
		pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt 


Run breedcafs server:
	export FLASK_APP=run.py
	flask run
	ctrl+C
		The werkzeug server only seems to work after trying to kill it...
		To kill it later (for a restart etc.) use:
	killall -9 python
		The above is broken behaviour but won't matter in production because we will be using another server (e.g. Apache)


To configure email you need to export the following environment variables:
or modify the email settings in instance/config.py
	export MAIL_PASSWORD=<your-gmail-app-password-here>
	export MAIL_USERNAME=<your-username@gmail.com>

Visit the website at localhost:5000. You should be able to register if your email is in ALLOWED_EMAILS
