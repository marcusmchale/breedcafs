This depends all depends on a working neo4j install. For development we perform setup in a virtual environment. An instance folder containing a config file is required but not available in the github repo. This file contains 

SETUP:
Clone the breedcafs repository:
	git clone https://github.com/marcusmchale/breedcafs

Add the instance folder:
	mkdir breedcafs/instance
	cp /path/to/secret/config.py breedcafs/instance/config.py

Set up neo4j:
	Install:
		sudo apt-get install neo4j
	Run neo4j:
		sudo neo4j console


Set up virtual environment:
	Install:
		on ubuntu:
			sudo apt-get install virtualenv
	Initialise:
		virtualenv venv
	Activate (from breedcafs folder):
		. ./venv/bin/activate
	Install requirements:
		pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt 


Run breedcafs server:
	export FLASK_APP=run.py
	The werkzeug server only seems to work after trying to kill it...:
		ctrl+C
	Then to kill it:
		killall -9 python

The above is broken behaviour but won't matter in production because we will be using another server (e.g. Apache)

To configure email you need to export the following environment variables:
or modify the emaail settings in instance/config.py
	export MAIL_PASSWORD=<your-gmail-app-password-here>
	export MAIL_USERNAME=<your-username@gmail.com>
